# ingmod.sh 

Ingmod.sh is a bash script that is designed to expand the capabilities of the Moodle teaching platform: it allows embedded Cloze questions where the numbers for numerical answers are generated and the multiple choice questions are latex-based and the appearance of answers is fully random. It needs a xml template (*xmltemp), a python calculation script (*py), a file which holds the parameter ranges and the equations (*param), and a control file (*ingmod).
